ðŸ‘‹Hello everyone!ðŸ‘‹
This is my first project on GitHub!
I wanted to post a simple project for a long time but always doubted.
Today I decided to try. I did it for less than an hour so don't expect much :3
This code is not useful, it was made just for fun,
maybe people who are just starting to program will be able to extract some knowledge from here.

I think I won't update this project anymore since it served more as a start in posting my projects on GitHub than as a full-fledged project.
